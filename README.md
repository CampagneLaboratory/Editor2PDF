Editor2PDF
== Overview
This software makes it possible to attach an annotation to an arbitrary MPS editor cell and render the cell to a PDF file output. The software uses iText to output PDF.
== Usage
This language provides an annotation that makes it possible to mark an editor cell for rendering to PDF format. Adding the annotation is possible on any MPS concept (BaseConcept and descendants). To render to PDF, you need to provide an output directory and a file basename. After you have completed this step, you can use the intention "Render to PDF" available on the annotation as many times as you need to regenerate the PDF output. The PDF output will display the content of the editor as it appears in MPS.
